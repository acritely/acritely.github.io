For example typing with the wrong keyboard selected could create 'ξθστ τηισ' instead of *'just this'* or *'den j;erv'* instead of *'δεν ξέρω'*. To solve this issue, simply run the AutoHotKey script in the background and simply press **ctrl-g** or **ctrl-shift-g** to switch between keyboards. No more deleting the last line you typed!\r\n\r\n\r\n## HostFileSync\r\nA python script to copy the host file from [someonewhocares.org](http://www.someonewhocares.org) and update your machine's local host file.\r\n\r\n",
